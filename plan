fretboard display:
    overall we want,
        - change between notes and fingerings
        - bending notes
        - show the scale(s) behind the song
        - custom color/design
        - detect non standard tuning?
    start with minimum cababilities,
        - we need to process and audio file,
          later we need an API or to make a
          way to import audio, (manual, spotify, youtube)
        - after getting that information we need
          to isolate the guitar, to start I think
          I should ignore that and just send in raw guitar
        - take that guitar and turn it into some datatype
          to store the notes that were played, if not
          storing than we should run in real time,
          play the song without audio and compute
          directly from the audio
        - display what notes are being played on the
          fretboard, which should be storing the fretboard
          as some type of data type
        - Place and remove dots on the respective places
          on the neck
----------------------------------------------------------
questions:
    APIs?
        - what
        - can I recreated it?
